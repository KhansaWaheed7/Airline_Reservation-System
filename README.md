# Airline_Reservation-System
This airline management system was developed as a course project for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It implements core DSA concepts such as doubly linked lists for ticket management, file handling for persistent data storage, and class-based modular design for managing passengers, flights, and administrators.
